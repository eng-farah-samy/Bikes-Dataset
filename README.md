# Transforming Raw Data into Actionable Insights: My Bike Sales Dashboard Journey
For a long time, and as I was just starting in the Data analysis field, I decided to complete my first project with the help of [Alex the Alayst](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opJgMj1IUrc).<br />
It was very beneficial and helped me a lot at the beginning of my journey. <br />
Now, I've decided to redesign the dashboard for this project in Power BI <br />
#### You can find the Data I used [Here](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/Excel-Tutorial/blob/main/Excel%20Project%20Dataset.xlsx)
## The Goal was  :  
gain deep insights into bike sales trends. 
## Steps :
1. Cleaning and understanding our Data
1. Handling the Null values
1. Finding the Relationship in data
1. Visualize to data to get insights and draw conclusions
## The visualization should answer these questions :
1. How many Bikes Sold?
1. Did the Age affect the purchase?
1. Did the Community distance an A factor that made the Purchases increase?
1. Average Income of male and female and how it affects the Purchase.
1. Have any other factors that can affect it?
1. What is the Average Income and Age?
** With meticulous data cleaning and wrangling, I ensured our dataset was impeccable and free from errors and inconsistencies. **
